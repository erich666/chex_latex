\section{Algorithms that Use Hardware}
Here we'll discuss the very many algorithms that can be implemented on the GPU. For more information, Castelli
\cite{Castelli2018} gives a thorough overview of the use of mip-maps for level of detail, compute shaders for
frustrum culling, etc. and discusses which APIs support these techniques. Basically, you can use anything from
DirectX 12\index{DirectX 12} with C++ to WebGL\index{WebGL} with Javascript/index{JS2018} as your API , due
to that these all talk to the same underlying hardware. More specifically, there is literally no better way to
to accelerate processing data, vs. using just the CPU--so ''just do it''.
